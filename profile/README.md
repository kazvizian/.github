### Welcome to the KazVizian Ecosystem

KazVizian is a living framework — a fusion of **technology**, **humaniora**, **art**, and **education**,  
born from the vision of [KazViz](https://kazviz.com).

Every project here is part of a greater constellation:  
frameworks, philosophies, and experiments built with clarity, openness, and deep intent.
